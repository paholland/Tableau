### Tableau Project

    A dashboard that visualizes the aggregated data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs.
    To complete a number of visualizations as well as providing an analysis explaining any phenomenon uncovered by these visualizations utilizing Tableau.

Discovered Phenomenon Visualizations (4-10 total visualizations, A total of 2 dashboards (1 for
each phenomenon), Data is cleaned (i.e. No outliers or bad data), Visualizations can logically be used to discover the solved phenomenon (i.e. they are not just random visualizations)

City Official Requested Maps (Visualization includes all of the
following: Maps all bike stations, Station markers indicate popularity in some way (color, size, etc.), Sections are marked by zip code, A write-up on the trends that
were discovered while making the map. Advanced: Visualization includes all of the following: Maps all bike stations, Station markers indicate popularity in some way (color, size,
etc.), Ability to change marker data based on month and year, Sections are marked by zip code, A write-up on the trends that
were discovered while making the map

Presentation (Phenomenon visualizations, Phenomenon dashboards, One of the city officialâ€™s requested maps, Arranged in a logical order (i.e.
Visualizations for each phenomenon with each other, not all mixed up.)

Analysis (Analysis on both uncovered phenomena, using the dashboards as a visual guide. Analysis on the chosen city, official requested map detailing any
noticeable trends. Both write-ups are logically sound. Write-ups are written in a manner that a non-data scientist/analyst could understand.
